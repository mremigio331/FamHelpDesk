## Summary
### Current Status
- **Created**: 14 endpoints
- **Pending**: 47 endpoints
- **Not Implemented**: 1 endpoint (family deletion for safety)
- **Not Implemented**: 1 endpoint (family deletion for safety)
- **Pending**: 51 endpoints

### Priority Order (Recommended Implementation)
1. **Family endpoints** (GET, PUT, DELETE family)
2. **Queue endpoints** (CRUD operations)
3. **Ticket endpoints** (CRUD and status management)
4. **Comment endpoints** (CRUD)
5. **Membership endpoints** (family and group members)
6. **Search & filtering** (ticket search, my tickets, open tickets)
7. **Audit endpoints** (audit history)
8. **Statistics/Dashboard** (analytics)

### Next Steps
Based on the UI doc requirements, the most critical endpoints to implement next are:
1. `GET /queue/{family_id}/{group_id}` - For populating queue dropdown when creating tickets
2. `POST /ticket/{family_id}/{queue_id}` - For creating tickets
3. `GET /family/{family_id}/members` - For populating assign-to dropdown
4. `GET /ticket/{family_id}` - For displaying ticket lists with filters
